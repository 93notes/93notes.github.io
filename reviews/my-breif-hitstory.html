<p><font size="4"><strong>Snippet</strong>:</font> A very short, quick insight into the man and the scientist; touching briefly on his personal life and two marriages. It is a very small window we are given to look into this great man's life. </p> 

<p><strong>Review:</strong> </br>
I have always been intrigued and fascinated by Stephen Hawking but knew very little about him, his work and his life. </p>
<p>After seeing the movie, "The Theory of Everything" based on the book by his first wife Jane, I became even more interested and wanted to learn more. My Brief History is truly that.

<p>A very brief history. Stephen Hawking's autobiography is 126 pages long, and would have probably been less than a hundred without the many photographs included.
</p>
<p>The first half of My Brief History briefly goes into Hawking's early years (he was born exactly three hundred years after Galileo's death), family, education, career, first marriage, and the years following his diagnosis with ALS.
</p>

<p>The second half of the book delves into Hawking's career as a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, including his work on gravitational waves, black holes, and time travel. </p>
<p>I was never very good at ordinary physics, so the theoretical stuff tends to go way over my head--a sure sign that I should try reading A Brief History of Time, Hawking's most famous work. </p>
<p> An interesting bio, brief and to the point. Fans of chunky biographies should look elsewhere.</p>
