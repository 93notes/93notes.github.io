<p><font size="4"><strong>Snippet</strong>: </font><font size="3"> If this book were a person, I would characterize it as - uninteresting, boring, repetitive & obsessed with arranged marriage! 
</p>

<p>How to start with my disappointment. It is the most ordinary book I have ever read (I want my money back). The reasons which added to my ever growing frustration with this book are:
</p>

&#9632; <strong>Creativity: Zero</strong>:- The author has not shown any creativity at all. All the examples in the book were too too ordinary. I felt like I can write a book after reading this book(believe me i am a very bad writer).

&#9632; <strong>The chapters look like a text book of some software engineering from an author trying to be cool.

&#9632; <strong>The content of the book looked liked an answer sheet to me written by a student in his engineering examination, who doesn't know the answer so trying to put same point again and again, sometime in form of paragraph and sometime in the form of Table. Yes table dude its not your company report why tables??.

I could hardly smile after reading the book(I left it with 2 chapter remaining). 
I picked up this book, undoubtedly and like many others, only because of the title. I thought this is an attempt to satirically delve into some of the aspects of Software Engineer's life. Hmm....that was not to be the case.

The experiences described in the book do not portray the reality of the Software Engineering field. Statements on the lines of "Fair skinned and beautiful people go onsite" is absurd and clearly point to either of these:
1. The author, inspite of working in the software industry, has not "got it"!
2. Author's past work experiences have not been so good!

The author loves tables and comparisons, as is evident from the innumerable tables spilled all over the book! This is mildly OK in the beginning, however as you progress through the chapters, gets to you. Bad idea!

The book seems to be a collection of the author's experience in the software world, which does not seem to have been good so far!

Even if you discount all the problems mentioned above, there is no continuity to the chapters or clarity in the expressions. I am wondering why most of the chapters must end with the text "Now you know why/how......etc". There is a clear disconnect between the title of the book and the content.





Strongly NOT recommended!
