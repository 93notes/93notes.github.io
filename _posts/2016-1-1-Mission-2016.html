<p>As the time set upon 2015, I took a trip to <strong>Mysore > Ooty</strong>, which was preceded by my <strong>Good Bye to Bangalore</strong>. <a href="http://blog.pradeepsingh.xyz/2016/01/10/the-only-way-I-could-have-ever-gotten-into-IIT.html">I'm shifitng to Mumbai</a>.
</p>

<p>
So there I was, sitting on the Ooty Lake in Ooty, mulling over what my resolution for 2016 should be? </br>
(because nice weather and chilled beer generally bring out the thinker in me).
</p>

<p>
To be honest, I do have a long list of goals this year —  </br>
get in a toned shape, </br>
learn how to shave, (I hate shaving :P)</br>
get rid of these messy &amp; long hairs (My Mothers Dream :P),</br>
write something once a week,</br>
get better at frisbee,</br>
among other important things like taking many of my social projects to its pinnacle and sending my parents on their first trip abroad.
</p>

<p>
But it came to me that there’s once critical change I must make to my personality, something that has done more harm than good to me in the past.
And something that I’d answer if I ever get asked, “<strong>What is your greatest weakness?</strong>”.  </br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Attachment. </strong>
</p>

<p>
I’ve come to realize, especially over the past 3-4 years, is that I get attached to things too soon, too strongly — to tangible and intangible objects, to people, and to emotions. </p>
<p>
2015 has been a roller-coaster ride for me, both personally and professionally. There have been so many crests and troughs, some I had to endure with those closest to me, while the others, all alone. But in most cases, those which involved things that I had gotten attached to have hurt the most. 
</p>
So 2016 is going to be the year I’ll try out this experiment. I’ll shun all attachment to everything whatsoever.</br>
</p> 
<p><strong>But how exactly?</strong>
</p>

<p>
That, I need to find an answer soon. It’s easier said than done, and it takes a sage to do it, which I’m aware of. But one small step at a time, and I shall do it. Slowly, but surely.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and <strong>happy new year</strong>. May 2016 be your best one ever!
