It’s hard to kill your dreams. But it’s harder to kill your dreams in motion. Today it happened - I quit <a href="http://rri.res.in/">Raman Research Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>
This was a long and painful one. </br>
It just became official today. Painful for people involved. Who’s projects &amp; confidence on me was at stake.
I killed it.
</p>

<p>I have decided to join <a href="http://iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay </a> as Research Assistant, where I will be working as part of <a href="http://www.csre.iitb.ac.in/isro_cell/">IIT Bombay - ISRO Cell </a> on a project sponsered by <a href="http://www.sac.gov.in/sacwebi/sacHomePage.iface">Space Application Centre, ISRO, Ahmedabad</a>.

</p>

<p>I'll be writing a detail post on my experience at RRI very soon. Work in Progress. </p>

<p> <strong>PS: </strong>Thanks to Dad for keeping me sane through this. </p>
